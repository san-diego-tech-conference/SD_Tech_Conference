        There are two tracks available for applications to the San Diego Undergraduate Tech Conference:
    </p>
    <h3>Track 1: Established Projects</h3>
    <p>Submit an <strong>abstract</strong> of the project that you would use in your paper (about 250 words). (Don’t worry about perfection. You can edit this for your final Summer submission.)</p>
    <p>Submit any <strong>materials</strong> you have already developed for this project.</p>
    
    <h3>Track 2: Emerging Projects</h3>
    <p>Submit a project <strong>proposal</strong> (≥ 300 words). This can be in bullet or paragraph form.</p>
    <p>Include a <strong>Proof of Concept</strong>, which should demonstrate feasibility. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset you're working with</li>
        <li>Initial basic experiments</li>
        <li>Demo or simplified simulation</li>
        <li>Detailed analytical argument, perhaps including examples of similar projects</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When you're ready to submit your application, you can do so through <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rzDWWH-4ytHpyIjoJF7xkPvsrbebqWS-iH42dQ8ojOs/">this Google Form</a>. It contains additional information regarding application requirements, so plan time to fill it out. We look forward to seeing your contributions!
